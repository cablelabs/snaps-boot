## 2 Environment Prerequisites

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements are based on the OPNFV Pharos Specification
https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/pharos/Pharos+Specification.
Areas where SNAPS-Boot differs from Pharos are noted below.
The current release of SNAPS-Boot is tested on the following platform.

**Compute Node**

| Hardware Required | Configuration |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Server machine with 64bit Intel AMD architecture. | 16GB RAM, 80+ GB Hard disk with 3 network interfaces. Server should be network boot Enabled and IPMI capable. |

**Controller Node**

| Hardware Required | Configuration |
| ----------------- |  ------------- |
| Server machine with 64bit Intel AMD architecture. | 16GB RAM, 80+ GB Hard disk with 3 network interfaces. Server should be network boot Enabled and IPMI capable. |

**Build Server**

| Hardware Required | Configuration |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Server machine with 64bit Intel AMD architecture. | 16GB RAM, 80+ GB Hard disk with 1 network interface. |

### 2.2 Software Requirements

| Category | Software version |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Operating System |  Ubuntu 16.04 |
| Scripting | Python 2.6.X |
| Framework |  Ansible 2.3.0. |

### 2.3 Network configuration

- All host machines must have identical network interfaces.
- 3 NICs per server are recommended, but only two are required.
 - When only two physical networks are configured, one is used for PXE
deployments and the other is used for VNF traffic.
 - When three physical networks are used, the external and tenant
 traffic are separated.
- Each NIC needs to be on a separate VLAN.
- The first NIC is the management network.  This is used to install Linux
on the host machines.
- All host machines are connected to Build Server (machine
running SNAPS-Boot) and have Internet access connectivity via data
interface.

> Note: Build Server should have http/https and ftp proxy if
node is behind corporate firewall. Set the http/https proxy for apt.

### 2.4 Build Server Setup

The Build Server is where you run SNAPS-Boot. You will need to install
Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial as host OS. This host needs to be able to reach the Internet
to download the software.

1. Install Ubuntu on the Build Server
1. Download SNAPS-boot from GitHub
```
wget https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot/archive/master.zip
```
1. Extract the files
```
unzip master.zip
```

> Note: Git can also be used to clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot.git
```

1. Install

```
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install -r snaps-boot/requirements-drb.txt
sudo pip install -e snaps-boot/
```

>:warning: Note:  If you use git, make sure not to push your changes back to the repository.
## 3 Configuration

### 3.1 snaps-boot Configuration

Configuration file used for hardware provisioning. Options defined here
are used by deployment layer to discover and net boot host machines,
allocate IP addresses, set proxies and install operating system on
these machines.

Use the doc/conf/hosts.yaml file as a template for configuring your
environment for use as your -f argument to iaas_launch.py. (note: the
file does not need to be called hosts.yaml or reside in any particular
directory)

#### DHCP:

Configurations defined here are used to discover host machines and
dynamically allocate IPs to them.

Deployment layer installs a DHCP server on the Build Server and
configures it to allocate IPs to host machine. This DHCP server can be
configured to support multiple subnets. For each subnet, DHCP parameters
and fixed IPs must be defined.

The DHCP section of the hosts.yaml file is only used for the management 
network to install the servers. After the servers are installed the networking 
information in the hosts section can be configured statically on all interfaces 
including the management network.

The management and data networks are mandatory.  The tenant network is recommended, but is optional.

> Note: **For static IP allocation define section ‘STATIC’**

Configuration parameters for the subnet section are explained below.

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| subnet | Y | Subnet address e.g. 10.10.10.0 |
| dn | Y | Domain name of Build Server. |
| dns | Y | IP of domain name server. |
| netmask | Y | Netmask of the subnet. |
| range | Y | IP range to be used on this subnet. User is required to define a string of first and last ip address, see example below "172.16.109.210 172.16.109.224" |
| router | Y | IP of external router (gateway ip). |

> Note: For optional parameters, use null value **“”** if not required.

#### PROXY:

Build Server and all other host machines requires internet
connectivity to download open source tools (python, Ansible etc.) and
OpenStack services. User is required to set FTP, HTTP, HTTPs and NG-CACHER  proxies
on these machines if internet access is restricted by firewall.

## 4 Installation Steps

### 4.1 Server Provisioning

Note:  All of the following steps are executed within the root directory of your 
snaps-boot project.  This will usually be snaps-boot/, so it assumed you are in this 
directory. 

#### Step 1

##### PXE BIOS Install
Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

Download `ubuntu16.04` or `CentOS-7` server image from internet and need to place it
in folder `snaps-boot/packages/images/`. 
Use following download links for ISO:
##### For ubuntu
 http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd64.iso
##### For centos
 Download the latest "Everything ISO" from https://www.centos.org/download/

```
mkdir -p packages/images
cd packages/images
wget http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd64.iso
wget http://mirror.umd.edu/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1804.iso
```
Note: Please ensure that Ubuntu 16.04 server will be used to configure CentOS 7 PXE Server.

##### PXE UEFI Install
>:exclamation:CentOS is not yet supported for UEFI Installs
 
Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

Download `grubnetx64.efi.signed` from internet and need to place it
in folder `packages/images/`.  
Use this download link:  
    http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial/main/uefi/grub2-amd64/current/grubnetx64.efi.signed

Download `ubuntu16.04 server image` from internet and need to place it
in folder `packages/images/`.  
Use this download link for ISO:  
    http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd64.iso.
    
```
mkdir -p packages/images
cd packages/images
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial/main/uefi/grub2-amd64/current/grubnetx64.efi.signed
wget http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.4-server-amd64.iso
```

#### Step 2
Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

Go to directory `conf/pxe_cluster`.

Modify file `hosts.yaml` for provisioning of OS (Operating System) on
cloud cluster host machines (controller node, compute nodes). Modify
this file according to your set up environment only.

Note:
For provisioning only ubuntu PXE Server, Keep ubuntu list under TFTP section in hosts.yaml.  
For provisioning only centos PXE Server, Keep centos list under TFTP section in hosts.yaml.  
For provisioning both, Keep both ubuntu and centos lists under TFTP section in hosts.yaml.
      
#### Step 3

Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

Run `PreRequisite.sh` as shown below:

```
sudo ./scripts/PreRequisite.sh
```

If you see failures or errors, update your software, remove obsolete
packages and reboot your server.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get auto-remove
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 4

Steps to configure PXE and DHCP server.

Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)


Run `iaas_launch.py` as shown below:

```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -p
```

Note: This updates the networking on the server and may cause your
ssh session to be terminated.

##### Step 4a
>:warning: This step is only if you require custom or proprietary drivers, such as ethernet.  If not you should skip this step. 

If your target servers require custom or proprietary drivers, you will need to provide your own initrd.gz file
for both the installer and the installation. 

For more on injecting driver modules into an initrd.gz file see

>http://www.linux-admins.net/2014/02/injecting-kernel-modules-in-initrdgz.html

Once you have a customized initrd.gz, make a backup of the existing initrd.gz

```
sudo cp <tftpdirectory>/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz <tftpdirectory>/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz.backup
sudo cp <www/html directory>/ubuntu/install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz <www/html directory>/ubuntu/install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz.backup
```

Now copy your initrd.gz file to each location
```
sudo cp initrd.gz <tftpdirectory>/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz 
sudo cp initrd.gz <www/html directory>/ubuntu/install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/initrd.gz 
```

#### Step 5

Manually verify DHCP server is running or not, using the given command below:

```
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server.service
```

State should be active running.
If it is not running, then double check the hosts.yaml file and look
at /var/log/syslog for error messages.

Manually verify tftp-hpa service is running or not, using the given
command below:

```
sudo systemctl status tftpd-hpa
```

State should be active running.

Manually verify apache2 service is running or not, using the given
command below:

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

State should be active running.

#### Step 6
Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

##### When PXE Server is either ubuntu or centos
Run `iaas_launch.py` as shown below:
```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -b
```
This will provision either ubuntu or centos OS on host machines, depending on the PXE Server.

##### When PXE Server is both ubuntu and centos
To provision ubuntu OS on host machines, Run `iaas_launch.py` as shown below:
```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -b ubuntu
```
or  

To provision ubuntu OS on host machines, Run `iaas_launch.py` as shown below:
```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -b centos
```

This will boot host machines (controller/compute nodes), select
NIC Controller (PXE client enabled) to use network booting.

Your OS provisioning will start and will get completed in about 20
minutes.  The time will vary depending on your network speed and
ip aserver boot times.

#### Step 7
Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

Execute this step only if static IPs to be assigned to host machines.

Run `iaas_launch.py` as shown below:
```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -s
```
>:warning: This step will reboot each target server when it is done.  
Wait a few minutes then ping and/or ssh each management server to verify  
it is back up. 

#### Step 8
Go to root directory of the project (e.g. `snaps-boot`)

Execute this step either for defining large memory pages or for
isolating CPUs between host and guest OS.

```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -i
```

> Note: This step is optional and should be executed only if CPU
isolation or large memory page provisioning is required.

## 5 Clean-up and Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Roll-back Isolated CPUs and Huge Pages

```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -ic
```

This will modify grub file on all host machines to remove isolated cpu
and huge page configuration and will boot the machine to default
configuration.

### 5.2 Roll-back Static IP Configuration and Change Default Routes
Back to Management Interface

```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -sc
```

This will modify etc/network/interfaces file to remove static entries of the interfaces and will change back default route to management interface.

### 5.3 Roll-back of SNAPS-Boot Installation

```
sudo -i python $PWD/iaas_launch.py -f $PWD/conf/pxe_cluster/hosts.yaml -pc
```

This will stop DHCP, PXE and TFTP services on Build Server.
